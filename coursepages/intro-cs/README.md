# Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python

This course will introduce you to the world of computer science and programming, giving you a flavor of the material to come. If you finish the course wanting more, Computer Science is likely for you!

This course has been developed by MIT and is available on [MIT's OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu) platform.

> Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python programming language.

## Instructions

1. Open the [course link](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/pages/material-by-lecture/) given above. You will see a list of Lectures.
2. Clicking on the link of a particular lecture will present all the materials from that lecture to you.
3. Work through all the course lectures as given in the link above. Watch the videos, do the finger exercises, and then solve the problem sets.
4. You are not supposed to complete the problem sets as soon as they appear on a lecture page. You are supposed to start thinking about it from that point. The actual due dates, according to the [course calendar](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/pages/calendar/) are:

   - PSET 0 - Before lecture 1
   - PSET 1 - Before lecture 9
   - PSET 2 - Before lecture 12
   - PSET 3 - Before lecture 16
   - PSET 4 - Before lecture 20
   - PSET 5 - Before lecture 25

6. There are links to solution of finger exercises on each lecture page. Match your answers to the given solutions to grade yourself.
7. Each problem set come with a script and instructions to check your solution. Use them to grade yourself.
8. You don't need to install the full Anaconda distribution to do this course. See the notes section below for more information.
9. If you are stuck somewhere, feel free to ask questions. You can join the OSSU chat for this course here: <https://discord.gg/jvchSm9>.
